My favourite brand in the world is Amul. I have much emotionally attached to the brand because of ,ofcourse the delicious chocolates and ice creams, and also because of the cute little moppet girl having a naughty and cheerful personality.The poster put out by Amul every fortnight featuring the girl in one of the recent news derived poster is quite attractive and I still wait for one to come out. I enjoy the way in which they come up with these innovative ideas of getting butter into these situations,sounds hilarious but is not an easy task certainly. I have enjoyed every product of its,have never heard of any disputes created within it,have loved the way the brand has progressed and enjoyed their way of publicising the brand. Cause its utterly beautiful and expeditious Amul :p
